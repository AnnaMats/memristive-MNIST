# memristive-MNIST

Here, the neural network simulation from the manuscript "Printing Polyaniline based Organic Memristive Devices for approaching neuromorphic computing applications" is presented. The memristive data is provided for the opportunity to reproduce the results from the article. The data for 3 memristive devices with different length dimensions (200, 100, 10) with cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device variations are presented. The memristive conductances are incorporated in the neural network simulation and play the role of synaptic weights.

All questions on the neural network simulation and obtained results may be directed to Anna Matsukatova (an.matcukatova@physics.msu.ru). 

Please, add references to the article if you use this code or any of the obtained results.
